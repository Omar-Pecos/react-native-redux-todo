ToDox is a hybrid React Native app using Redux, React functional components and hooks with the idea to be tested in a Android device (I can´t test on iOS)

The idea is about to create a simple React Native application for learning purposes, fetching data from an API Rest ( https://api-node-to-do.omarpv.repl.co/)

## Technologies 
> React functional components using **hooks** , with **redux** and **react-redux** gives this application the ability to use a Redux store to handle and persist a local state, connected to our components and be able to provide them with data. Even performing operations that only affects the local state, like mark a todo as favorite  or mark it as done/undone
> The fecthing data to API are asyncs requests with the use of **axios** and **redux-thunk**

 > It uses **react-navigation/native** and **react-navigation/stack** to navigate between the Add/Edit/Delete confirmation screens and the root component (ToDo List). 
 
 > Uses **react-native** components to create the views and **react-native-in-app-message** to display notifications
